# _Mindfulness_

#### By _**Andrew Accuardi**, **James Padilla**, **Trevor Malloy**_

## Description

_The mindfulness application sought embody the idea that a user experience on a website should not be distracting, but empowering in such a way that allows the user to use the tool in a meaningful manner. Mindfulness allows the user to log their feelings and rate their mood before and after a meditation session so they can reflect on their thoughts. The user can then share these experiences with others if they like and gain insight, or keep them private as a personal log._
